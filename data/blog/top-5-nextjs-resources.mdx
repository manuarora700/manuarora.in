For all the developers out there who are working with [React](https://reactjs.org) and are _NOT_ working with [Next JS](https://nextjs.org) are missing out on the best framework available out there.
Even my personal website [manuarora.in](https://manuarora.in) is built with Next JS.

[Next JS](https://nextjs.org) is a production ready framework for react to build and ship React applications faster. It is developed by [Vercel](https://vercel.com) which also manages hosting of modern day frameworks. You can connect your Next JS Git repository with vercel it deploys the website on every commit.

Some of the **features** of Next JS are:

- **Hybrid**: SSG and SSR (Static Site Generation, Sever Side Rendering)
- **File System Routing**
- **API Support**
- **Typescript Support**
- **Image Optimization**
- **Zero Config**
- **NextJS Analytics**

As mentioned on the official [Next JS](https://nextjs.org)

> “Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.”

It is really important for React developers to learn Next JS and implement it in their workflow.

Here is a list of **Top 5 Next JS resources** to learn Next JS in 2020.

If you've taken any course from [fireship.io](https://fireship.io) or watched **Jeff's** [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA) then you know what I'm talking about. This Next JS is to the point and precise. Jeff follows a fast paced teaching approach, explaining all the concepts in great detail.

Also, you get to [build a project](https://next.fireship.io) from scratch which is a big plus. I'm a huge fan of fireship's real world projects, and here we build a blogging platform (Medium, Dev.to style) with real world authentication, username generation, image uploads and more.

**Benefits**
